drugreviews
==============================

Drug review dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29#

Getting Started
------------

1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/drugreviews
```

2. Set up conda environment
```
make create_environment
make requirements
```

3. Activate environment
```
conda activate drugreviews
```

4. Download the data
```
make download_data
```

Adding requirements
----------------

If you add packages locally for your work, add them to the requirements.txt file.
First, make sure you're in the drugreviews environment, so you don't remove existing dependencies that we want to keep!

1. Save all the package names from your current environment.
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

2. Add and commit
```
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "I added these packages for <this reason>"
```
